\section{Conclusion}

research question answer: it is possible to detect a speckle pattern in motion using a discrete photodiode array 


limitations: 
- in sunlight, the opamp saturates and the signal is unrecoverable
- Bandwidth should be increased for

% --------------------------------------
\subsection{Future work}
\label{sub:future_work}

- use an opamp with higher GBW for higher Bandwidth
- use a current to digital amplifier chip like the DDC118 for higher integration
- subtrace the vibrations of the sensor itself using an accelerometer
